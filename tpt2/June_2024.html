    <p>Significant time was spent on coding practice, resting, and playing some <i><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/9306257030/FLOOR-10-Guess-It">Guess It!</a></i></p> (new floor came and my <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> suggestion is in it). I'm sorry, but when you have a nagging dad who determines your worth based on my performance on the coding practice... (Also, Claude 3.5 Sonnet couldn't correctly solve my current part.)</p>
    
    <p>Okay, I got the head done (but without the mouth, which I put later.)</p>

    <p>Building out of pre-made shapes, not shapes you can make by yourself, is inflexible and will result in the model looking... scruffy, but it's inevitable.</p>

    <p>Seriously, it's hard to build with primitives at night, even with night light on! You can't see the outlines and shades of parts.</p>

    <img src="images/Modeling at night is a pain in the neck.png"/>

    <p>Build so far (as you can see in the background, I made a backup copy):</p>

    <p>Most of the day was spent working on coding practice assigned by my father, who still <s>pesters</s> contacts me through phone. I had neglected it for a while, but forunately, Claude 3.5 Sonnet got me forward; it is a <i>godsend</i>.</p>

    <p>I didn't feel like building the strip mall, so I decided to start a "Disable collisions" build: A Sonic the Hedgehog prop to submit to Theme Park Tycoon 2 Workshop. First, I drew some concept art for reference (my personal <i>Sonic</i> reference image collection and my Sonic action figure came in handy):</p>

    <img src="images/Sonic prop concept art.jpg"/>

    <p>Even though <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sonic/images/1/10/Sonic_Riders_Sonic.png">official art of Sonic with his hand on hip</a> exists, I had a hard time figuring out how to position his cartoon hand without breaking anatomy or making it awkward, so I decided to let the hand fall aside in the final build.</p>

    <p>Now for building with primitives once again- Oh gosh, you can't <i>stretch a sphere into an ovaloid</i>?!?! Take me back to creating in freeform, like writing song lyrics like I was doing in the past few days (you can listen to them set to AI-generated music <a href="https://suno.com/playlist/f2416036-2a70-4f11-b381-7aa81c25bcf9">here</a>). Heck, I'd rather work in Blender instead!</p>

    <img src="images/3D modeling is a lot less intuitive here.png"/>

    <p>At least I can study pictures of props others have built on Theme Park Tycoon 2 Workshop. (No, I'm not gonna buy the Extra Colors gamepass. I'm content with the pre-existing color palette.)</p>

    <p>So, you want a picture of my build so far today? Here you go. (Spoiler alert: I didn't get far.)</p>

    <p>I thought I was going to get the palm tree done today, but then I ran into a problem:</p>

    <img src="images/Palm tree problem.png"/>

    <p>While I could manually manipulate the bottom slopes to be together, the "pieces" of the leaves' base don't fit together to form a closed form. Bummer... I didn't know how to fix this without having to stretch that one piece, so I decided to put the Green Hill Zone aside for now.</p>

    <p>I have land put aside for a theme park kids' area; it's called the Fun Fawn Fair. It's supposed to be set within a woodland setting and feature anthropomorphic deer characters. So far, I have pretty much a merry-go-round and slide ride. I may show an image of them in a future post. I could've added the rides first, but I wanted to create the characters first so I know exactly how to theme where and whatsoever.</p>

    <p>On May 4, 2024, I jotted down a list of characters as only their archetypes, gender, and species:</p>

    <p><b>Fawns</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The "Hero" (boy) - Red deer</li>
      <li>The "Second-in-Command" (girl) - Reeve's muntjac</li>
      <li>The Reserved Girl - White-tailed deer</li>
      <li>The PLayful Boy - Sika deer</li>
      <li>The Thrillseeker Enby - Gray brocket</li>
      <li>The Boy in Touch with Nature - Water deer</li>
      <li>The Baby (Girl) of the Bunch - Southern pudu</li>
      <li>The Bookworm Enby - Mule deer</li>
      <li>The Crafty (in arts sence) Girl - Moose</li>
      <li>The Baby (Boy) of the Bunch - Southern red muntjac</li>
      <li>The Mischievous Girl - Red brocket</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Adults</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Santa Claus - Reindeer</li>
      <li>Mustang ranger - Marsh deer</li>
      <li>Shopkeeper - White-tailed deer</li>
      <li>Chef - Sika deer</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cervids">(Yes, I decided to get creative with cervid species!)</a></p>

    <p>Also, I drew the fawn's base:</p>

    <img src="images/The Fun Fawn Fair fawn base.jpg"/>

    <p>Today, I decided to sit down and start designing the individual characters before I could give them names. *inserts rambling anecdote about how UGC on Roblox is teen-oriented and I had to settle for online clothing catalogs*</p>

    <img src="images/The Leader and the Second-in-Command (lineart photo).jpg"/>

    <p>While my father is gone on a trip, meaning I can plan my day on my own, I went to a Dragon Boat Festival party for most of the afternoon, cutting out significant time for <i>Theme Park Tycoon 2</i> building. Also, I didn't want to just draw images for my builds; I want to actually build during this time. I started a new build: The strip mall, a feature of suburbia.</p>

    <img src="images/Starting a strip mall.png"/>

    <p>Within the hour I had left, I built the basics of a burger restaurant, with images to be my own designs!</p>

    <p>(This was kinda hard for me to write, because I was so sleepy.)</p>

    <p>More bad news: Today, I've been struggling with bad cold, which is why I couldn't get much done. As a result, this post is short.</p>

    <p>Before I succumbed to the cold, I completed some missions for credits and finally had enough to buy another plot of land. Only two more to go, each 1,500 credits each.</p>

    <img src="images/Only 2 more plots left.png"/>

    <p>(This was taken with the lowest manual graphics setting. My computer keeps heating up so much when running Roblox now.)</p>

    <p>I got some of the palm tree done. Grouping indeed makes building much easier. Now, I have to make up my mind interpreting the pieces of bark on the leaves' base.</p>

    <p>First of all, happy Pride Month! Be proud of who you are.</p>

    <img src="images/Happy Pride Month.png"/>

    <p>Second, bad news, my father has reduced his agreement to only me having half of the day to build in <i>Theme Park Tycoon 2</i>, so building may take longer than what I planned. Nevertheless, I'll try to make most of my time!</p>

    <p>Anyway, the first props I completed today were of the flowers.</p>

    <img src="images/Flowers complete.png"/>

    <p>I can ever climb the sunflower!</p>

    <p>I was considering using the game's premade props for the rest of Green Hill Zone's flora as my commitment to inspiring players without gamepasses. However, I had spent so much time on building much of Green Hill Zone's iconic props that using honestly out-of-place props would be obviously weird, and it's good to keep practice building.</p>

    <p>So, I made the bush. (Groups make building easier, as well as the ability to resize grouped parts. Also, I realized I could've used the pyramid primitive to make triangles instead of having to fuse two wedges together.)</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Bridge posts. (Yeah, I later discovered I miscolored them. I corrected this later. The rock was the only premade prop I decided to use, as it's fitting and saves time from crafting a nicely rough rock from scratch.)</p>

    <img src="images/Bridge posts complete (but miscolored).png"/>

    <p>Oh, and I became the only player in the server at one point. A public server.</p>

    <img src="images/That rare moment when you're the only player in a public server.png"/>

    <p>Hoo boy, Green Hill Zone's iconic palm tree looks complicated, and the premade palm tree looks awkward in place. Can I build it? Stay tuned for next week!</p>

    <p>Green Hill Zone ride as of June 1, 2024:</p>

    <img src="images/Green Hill Zone as of 6-1-2024.png"/>

    <p>(The ride takes up <i>lots of land</i>, so much that I bought the Extra Expansion Plots gamepass for ample space for future builds. Also, fun fact: Before the infamous music privacy update, I played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWHFr9KJGBk">this</a> over my sandbox park.)</p>
