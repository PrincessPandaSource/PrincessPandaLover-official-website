        <!--<img src="img/hildaterry.png" alt="Hilda Terry" class="clearfix leftPic"/>-->
        <p><i>Silver Scripts</i> is a <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> fan slice-of-life/comedy webcomic written and illustrated by PrincessPandaLover since 2024. Partially based on her life and experience with computer science, it follows Silver the Hedgehog leading his life as a college student majoring in computer science.</p>
        <p>The webcomic was created as a way for PrincessPandaLover to be motivated for a computer science major while still having fun and persuing an art and writing side gig. (Artists and other entertainers are known to typically not make decent income, so PrincessPandaLover is seeking a job to act as a financial safety net.)</p>
        <p>In spite of its topic, <i>Silver Scripts</i> is no worse than a typical PG-rated movie in America.</p>
        <p>The webcomic's schedule varies due to PrincessPandaLover's other work, especially schoolwork, and writer's block, but will usually be updated on Monday, the worst day of the week. Be sure to visit the site weekly to check! <i>Silver Scripts</i> is also posted on PrincessPandaLover's Twitter, DeviantArt, Tumblr, and Instagram, so you can follow her on there if you prefer automatic reminders.</p>
