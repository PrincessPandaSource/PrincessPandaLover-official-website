      This is a webpage where I put ideas I really want to put into fruition in the future, so I claim them before others do.

      <ul>
        <li><b><i>Sonic Chaos Coding</i></b> (c. April 2024): An educational <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> fangame that seeks to teach programming and computer science concepts to children ages 8-12, all with the familarity of Sonic's world.</li>
        <li><b><i>Sonic of the Rogues</i></b> (c. February 2024): A <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> fan board game that takes place in an alternate universe where your favorite <i>Sonic</i> heroes are Babylon Rogue-esque thieves, alongside the actual Babylon Rogues. Gameplay may involve a combination of racing and looting.</li>
        <li><b><i>Plantaeford</i></b> (c. February 2024): A (trading?) card game where you play as anthropomorphic plants who keep all sorts of animals as pets and try to outperform each other in adventures in the eponymous town of Planteford.</li>
      </ul>
