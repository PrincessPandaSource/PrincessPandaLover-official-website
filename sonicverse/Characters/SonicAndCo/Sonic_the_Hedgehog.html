  <h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>Sonic was born on June 23, 1991 to a hedgehog couple of Sky and Whisper Meadows. The couple are archeologists who first met each other at a site dig in Mobius' equivalent of South America; they fell in love with each other and Whisper joined Sky's archeology team so that they could be together. After marriage, they lived on Christmas Island for a few years, where they had Sonic. When Sonic was 3 years old, they moved to the mainland of the United Federation, specifically a town by the coast of the Pacific (not Emerald Town).</p>

<p>Sky and Whisper have enhanced speed, which was already common among Mobians (Sky even was a high school and university track athlete), but they never expected their son to gradually develop the speed that would outpace them and everyone else at the highest extreme. (They state that they only gave his Sonic his name to reflect the enhanced speed they thought he would only inherit, not mutate, and that his name was only coincidence.)</p>
