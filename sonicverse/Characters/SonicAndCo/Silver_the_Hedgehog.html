  <h2>Backstory</h2>
  <p>Silver was born to two heroes who worked in the Certainty City Squad: "the Horse", who was of silver color and psychokinetic, and "the Hedgehog", who was lumokinetic (could manipulate light).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when Silver was only a year old, his parents were killed in a deadly gas accident at a store they were shopping at while he was at home and being babysat by a robot. Because he had no kin who were willing to adopt him, the Child Protection Services sent him to foster care, which led him to be adopted by a male caecilian and male spider couple. Under their parentship and through special technology that allows external reproduction of same-sex couples' offspring, he had a younger spider brother.</p>

<p>Silver prepared to be only the next member of the Certainty City Squad (in the future, squads of superheroes are common and even everyone is prepared to fight against evil with their superpowers), but one day, his future suddenly changed from a prosperous one to a post-apocalyptic one, where there was only a wasteland littered with ruins. Fortunately, he also had the ability to time travel, one of the innate Chaos abilities, and thus went back to the past to find the cause of the apocalypse and stop it. Along the way, he met Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends, who helped him on his quest.</p>

<p>They became best friends as the result. Now, even when the future doesn't need fixing through time travel, Silver travels regularly to Sonic's time period and is also a member of the original Sonic and co, hanging out and defeating evil with them. He is still a Certainty City Squad member, pursuing Eggman Nega, Doctor Eggman's descendent in Silver's time. Because teenagers are still treated as immature adults in the future, he lives in his own apartment in a neighborhood of Certainty City far away from his parents.</p>
