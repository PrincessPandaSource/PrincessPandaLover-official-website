      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <!--<h2>The website itself</h2>
      <p><strong>Why did you decide to create a website from scratch for your fan universe?</strong><br>
      I created <a href="https://princesspandasonic.tumblr.com/">a Tumblr blog</a>, where I would post random articles and facts about the PrincessPandaSonicverse, but abandoned it because Tumblr seems to be dying, and anyway, a blog would be impractical for information that would be need to be organized like with this website.
      I later considered <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/princesspandaart">DeviantArt</a> to post my articles, but since DeviantArt seems to be dying also, I thought of another method to put all my articles about my fan universe. I then thought of creating my own website from 
      scratch with HTML and CSS. I had planned to create my personal website the same way before, and I knew my articles about the PrincessPandaSonicverse would be a great addition!<br><br>
      Yes, I am aware of World Anvil, and did set up <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/princesspandalovers-sonic-the-hedgehog-fan-universe-princesspandaworld"></a>the same, or an early version of the, fan universe</a> on there, but I wasn't interested for some reason.)<br><br>
      Why didn't I use a website builder? Well, ever since I discovered a children's book about web development with HTML, CSS, and Java and got into tinkering with CSS on MediaWiki-based wikis, I've been interested in creating a website 
      from pure code. While it takes time to master, it's more fun as you have way more freedom in what your website looks like.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How can I create a website that way?</strong><br>
      Khan Academy has <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming">a Computer Programming course</a> which teaches web development, including how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> is a great resource for beginners, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs</a> for any skill level.<br><br>
      There are many free web hosts online, in which I use <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Search for them and try to find one that suits your needs!
      </p>

      <p><strong>I noticed an error with the code.</strong><br>
      Glad you asked! I am still a beginner in web coding, so you may find lots of errors, such as unneccessary or deprecated code, messed-up design, and lack of accessibility. 
      While I'm in the process of checking and <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">validating</a> pages as I edit them, if you find errors that you think are important and need
      to be fixed, please contact me using the information found on <a href="/index.html">my homepage</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Where did a certain piece of info go?</strong><br>
      As I research more of the <i>Sonic</i> lore, improve my writing skills, and time goes by in general, I may rethink and revise some of my fanverse to be truer to canon and better.</p>

      <p><strong>Hey, you got something about canon wrong!</strong><br>
      Surprisingly, after 7 years of being a <i>Sonic</i> fan, I still only know the broad strokes of the game series. While I am currently reviewing <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Wiki_Zone">Sonic Wiki Zone</a> and watching longplays of the games to make up for this, I would really appreciate your 
      help! Just contact me with the information on <a href="/index.html">my homepage</a>.</p>
